# cats

Challenge: Create a simple CLI in your language of choice.

Scenario: You have been hired to create a new Command-Line Interface, cats. The cats CLI should handle a resource, cats, with commands for create, read, update, and delete.

Task 1: CRUD commands
add commands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The data storage can be mocked here, or you can choose to persist the data if you so choose

Task 2: Arguments
For create and update, add a relevant argument to be parsed by the CLI. For example, you could end up with cats create --name Sardine
